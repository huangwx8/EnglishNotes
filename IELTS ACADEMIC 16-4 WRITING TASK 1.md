The diagram illustrates how plastic bottles are recycled step-by-step.

Overall, this process is a man-made, cyclical process that consists of 9 distinct steps, where human labor and machines are involved. After these complex steps, plastic bottles are converted to raw material and used to make new products.

At the beginning, consumers throw plastic bottles to recyclable trash bins, where they will be collected by trash trucks regularly. Those bottles then are transported to the recycling center, where staff can sort them, distinguish which ones are recyclable and non-recyclable. Sorted bottles are compressed into blocks, and subsequently fed into crushing machines, resulting in tiny fragments.

Fragments need to be washed, in order to remove all dirt. After that, they are put into grinding machines, which receive fragments by funnels and blow ground pellets out. Following that, pellets should be heated and evaporate, forming the raw material. After that, manufacturers can finally make use of them to produce familiar commodities such as T-shirts, pencils and bags. When these products are thrown by consumers, the process repeats again.
