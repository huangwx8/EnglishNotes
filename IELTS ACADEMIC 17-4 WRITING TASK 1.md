The line graph demonstrates the number of closures and openings of shops in one nation, between 2011 and 2018.

**The line graph illustrates the number of shop closures and openings in a single nation between 2011 and 2018.**

Overall, number of closed shops was often larger than newly-opened in most years, except 2011 and 2015. There is one exception in 2015, when the number of closures was strangely low, but only for one year.

Both closures and openings show fluctuating and decreasing trend, while closure line is usually higher than opening line, specifically, 6 of 8 years: one range is from 2012 to 2014, and another spans across 2016 to 2018. In detail, during the first period, number of closures and openings averaged about 6500 and 5000, respectively. Over the second period, they were 5000 and 3500.

One year stands out as anomaly, 2015. From 2014 to 2015, the number of closed stores dropped dramatically, from 6500 to 500, decreased by over 90%! Nevertheless, the number bounced back to approximately 5000 in the following year.
