The first map describes the layout of current Norbiton industrial area, and the second map demonstrates how this area is planned to be developed to a residential area.

**The provided maps ==illustrate== the ==transformation== of the Norbiton industrial area. The first map ==depicts== the current layout, while the second map ==outlines== the planned development for this region to become a residential area.**

Norbiton industrial area is adjacent to a river in the north, it contains multiple factories which are connected by roads. However, the planned development will replace the factories with houses, build associated facilities like shops and school, and even construct a bridge across the river to the north.

**Current Norbiton Industrial Area located adjacent to a river in the north, the industrial area ==comprises several== factories ==that are interconnected by== roads. The proposed development ==involves replacing== all eight factories ==with== residential housing. Seven housing areas will be strategically distributed around the existing road network. ==Alongside== the housing, new facilities will be established, and two road expansion==s== are planned.**

The most noticeable change are the removals of all the 8 factories and the additions of new housing areas and facilities. As planned, 7 housing areas will be developed around the roads, with 3 in the south, 3 in the northwest, and 1 in the north. Shops and a medical center will be constructed near the central roundabout, and a playground and a school will also be built close to the southern housing areas.

**The most significant change==s== ==involve== the removal of all eight factories and the addition of new housing areas and facilities. ==As per== the plan, seven housing areas will be developed along the roads: three in the south, three in the northwest, and one in the northern part. Shops and a medical center will be constructed near the central roundabout, ==while== a playground and a school will also be built close to the southern housing areas.**

Another change worthwhile to be mentioned is two expansions of the existing roads. One expansion will go to the northwest, connecting the housing areas there with the roundabout, the other expansion will go to the north, with a bridge across the river, such the transportation between the northern residential area and other places is possible. 

**Another ==noteworthy== change ==involves== the expansion of the existing roads. One expansion will connect the housing areas in the northwest to the roundabout, while the other expansion will ==extend northward== with a bridge across the river, ==facilitating== transportation between the northern residential area and other places.**
