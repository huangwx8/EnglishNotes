**Recently, the number of people with health problems ==who choose== alternative medicines and treatments rather than visiting doctors has been increasing. This essay argues that this trend is negative and provides several reasons for it, from both patients’ and doctors’ perspectives.**

For patients, it is dangerous to their health. Numerous patients now try to use untraditional methods to deal with their diseases, such as natural medicines and meditation. Some of them may think they produce better effects, others do it simply because they are cheaper. However, these methods could detriment people's health further. Firstly, given that most of these methods are not validated by researchers scientifically, their medical effects are unknown, which means they likely could not help with your health, but damage it in unpredicted ways. Secondly, if you are lucky enough to find the right medicines for your disease, you probably do not know how much you should take without doctor's advice. Inappropriate intake can also affect your health adversely.

For doctors, it endangers their jobs. A doctor start its business after professional training and hard probation, then it can get considerable salary - a reward for its endeavor. But if more people follow the trend, medical industry will be suppressed, thus collage students will be less willing to major in medicine. Consequently, the overall level of expertise will drop, and health level of whole society may fall, what a disaster for human being!

**For doctors, this trend ==jeopardizes== their ==profession==. After undergoing professional training and ==rigorous== probation, doctors ==establish their practices== and ==earn a substantial salary== as a reward for their ==efforts==. However, if more people follow this trend, the medical industry will ==suffer==. As a result, fewer college students will ==be inclined to== major in medicine. Ultimately, the overall level of expertise will decline, ==potentially== affecting the health of society ==as a whole==—a ==disastrous== outcome for ==humanity==.**

In conclusion, this trend is bad for us all and should be stopped. In my
opinion, governments should make counter measures immediately, for example, fining those illegal medicine producers and teaching public to treat our bodies correctly.

**In conclusion, this trend is detrimental to all of us and should be ==curbed==. Governments should ==take== immediate ==countermeasures==, such as ==imposing fines on== illegal medicine producers and ==educating== ==the public== ==on== proper health practices.**
