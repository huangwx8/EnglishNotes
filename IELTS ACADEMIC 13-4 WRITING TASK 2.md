Nowadays, there is a phenomenon that although plenty of achievements have been made, people around the world still suffer from hunger. In this essay, I will present some reasons for it, and delve into some possible solutions.

**Nowadays, despite significant achievements, people around the world continue to suffer from hunger. In this essay, I will explore the reasons ==behind this issue== and propose potential solutions.**

The primary reason lies in the imbalanced distribution of technologies and infrastructure. Generally speaking, three factors are involved in agriculture: human labor, techniques, and infrastructure. Modern agriculture produces abundant crops thanks to advanced technologies such as ~~fertilizer and machines~~, and infrastructure including irrigation system and power grid. However, not all countries are fortunate enough to enjoy them. Take Nigeria as example, which has sufficient human resources, but poor industrial condition. According to reports from BBC News, over 50% of families in Nigeria do not have reliable water supply. Without basic infrastructure, it is impossible to develop agriculture for local residents.

**The primary reason for hunger lies in the imbalanced distribution of technologies and infrastructure. In agriculture, three critical factors come into play: human labor, techniques, and infrastructure. Modern agriculture benefits from advanced technologies like ==fertilizers and machinery==, ==as well as== essential infrastructure such as irrigation systems and power grids. Unfortunately, not all countries ==have equal access to== these resources. For instance, consider Nigeria, which possesses sufficient human resources but faces poor industrial conditions. Shockingly, over 50% of Nigerian families lack reliable access to water, ==hindering== local agricultural development due to the absence of basic infrastructure.**

Another noteworthy cause is political and economic issues. Considering that developed nations like United States is capable of producing 5 times of food than its citizens need, food companies can easily save thousands of lives in Africa if they want. Nevertheless, our economies are built upon the principle of capitalism, the major purpose of companies is making profits, not benefiting humanity. Moreover, as different countries are separate entities, governments in rich countries are also not inclined to address problems of poor countries, perpetuating this circumstance.

**Another significant cause of hunger is rooted in political and economic issues. Developed nations, such as the United States, produce far more food than their citizens requireâ€”up to five times the necessary amount. ==Paradoxically==, ==while food companies possess the means to alleviate hunger in Africa, their primary focus remains profit-driven rather than humanitarian==. Furthermore, ==the global economic system operates under capitalist principles, emphasizing financial gains over the well-being of humanity==. Additionally, because countries function as separate entities, governments in ==wealthier== nations often neglect the challenges faced by ==poorer== countries, perpetuating the cycle of hunger.**

In my opinion, to solve the problems above, the first priority should be enhancing international cooperations. It is essential for developed countries to recognize their responsibility to bridge the gap of development. To to specific, governments can encourage big companies to set up business in developing regions, with incentives such as tax reduction. By which technologies will be brought to the people in these regions, and infrastructure will also be built. In the long term, these countries will finally get rid of food shortage due to their help.

**In my view, addressing these challenges requires prioritizing international cooperation. Developed nations must acknowledge their responsibility in bridging the development gap. Specifically, governments can ==incentivize== large corporations to establish businesses in developing regions ==by offering tax reductions==. This approach would facilitate the transfer of technologies to these areas and promote infrastructure development. ==Over time==, such efforts can alleviate ==food shortages== in these countries.**

In conclusion, development imbalance and lack of cooperation are the source of why people still need to endue hunger, and selfless contribution can be the only solution. Sometimes, we will have to give up some short-term interest, for the betterment of our future.

**In summary, the imbalance in development and insufficient cooperation perpetuate hunger. The only viable solution lies in selfless contributions. Occasionally, we must prioritize long-term benefits over short-term interests to create a more equitable and nourished future.**
