It is predictable that all vehicles will be driverless in the future. In my opinion, the benefits of self-driving outweigh the drawbacks, and I will presents several reasons for it in this essay.

Firstly, self-driving significantly improves transportation safety. Nowadays, car accident is a primary reason for human death. According to a report from the BBC news, more than 10 people die in car accidents in Britain each day, and most of these accidents are caused by misjudges of humans. With self-driving, computers will take fully control. A huge benefit of that is computers seldom make mistakes, since they cannot be affected by emotion, alcohol and lack of sleep, which afflict us humans a lot.

Secondly, self-driving has potential to accelerate transportation. Professor Mark proposed an innovative idea - centralized coordination. To be specific, it means all vehicles are managed by a central computer, with advanced scheduling algorithm. With such an algorithm, it can design the best plan to maximize overall transportation efficiency, thereby minimize the time for commutes and logistics.

Thirdly, people can have more spare time thanks to self-driving. Imagine a world where you can enjoy yourself inside your car, instead of concentrating on steering, how many meaningful things you can do! If people can work, study and relax in their seats comfortably, undoubtedly it will improve the societal productivity as a result.

In conclusion, self-driving makes traffic safer, faster, and provides us with extra time. However, it still faces many difficult challenges. For instance, regulations and technologies. Although the future is unclear for now, I hope self-driving can be implemented in our daily lives, and contributes to the betterment of society.
