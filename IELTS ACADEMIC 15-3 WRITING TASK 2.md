Nowadays, some people think that advertising is an effective way in persuading customers to buy commodities, while others hold an opposite idea, thinking that advertising no longer worth attention. This essay supports the former opinion and provides some reasons for it.

From advocates' view, advertising is a powerful tool for businessmen, which has created a lot of commercial legends, there are even some cases in where advertising play a main role in commercial success. For instance, the diamond fever in 20th century. Diamonds, are pure carbon with special atom structure essentially, whose amount is massive around the global, and are not actually valuable. However, a decision made by diamond industry changed everything, they chose to utilize advertising to convince public that diamonds are valuable and deserve prohibitive prices. This strategy was successful, diamonds were welcomed by customers, and the prices are still high even today.

On the other hand, as the growth of capitalism and information technology, advertising are everywhere in modern lives. Commercials have become cheaper and ubiquitous, thus we can not easily be amazed by a novel commercial video on TV. This phenomenon leads to questioning voices: people watch dozens of commercials from streets, TVs, YouTube each day, and there are thousands of high-quality commodities in supermarkets, so why should I make purchase just due to one commercial?

In my opinion, the power of advertising is not as great as it used to be, but it is still a necessary part of business operation. Undoubtedly, as a businessman, there are more competitors manufacturing and advertising than before, but that is not the reason to stop advertising. However, businessmen should use more impressive ways to win the competition. A living example is TicTok, a short video company, recently developed a new advertising mode, streaming-sale, manufacturers recruit famous influencers to represent advantages of commodities in streaming. This mode is successful because this mode is more interactive, and can easily catch watchers' eyeballs.

In conclusion, traditional advertising methods are losing power, it would be wise for companies to try some new advertising avenues to gain or preserve markets in modern days.
