The two maps below illustrate the transformation of Grange Park between 1920 and today.

Overall, there are three primary changes. Firstly, the stage for musician in the west was replaced with a magnificent amphitheater. Secondly, a large rose garden occupies former central fountain's space. Thirdly, eastern area was thoroughly updated with new facilities.

In 1920, a relatively small but elegant stage sat in the west of the park, serving for musicians, now there is amphitheater with circular audience seats, which is larger and suitable for concerts. Another noteworthy change occurred in the middle, where the beautiful fountain is replaced with a square rose garden, surrounded by four seats area.

**In 1920, a ==modest== yet elegant stage ==stood in== the western part of the park, serving as a platform for musicians. ==Fast forward to today==, and that stage has been replaced by a magnificent amphitheater. The new amphitheater ==features== circular seating, ==making it ideal for== concerts and performances. The central fountain, once a focal point, ==has given way to== a large rose garden. *

The redevelopment in the east of the park is even more significant. In the past, a pond situated in the northeastern corner, however, it was developed into a play area for children's entertainment. In the southeast, we can see a nice water feature, a glasshouse used to be in the same place. Additionally, near the water feature, an extra entrance is constructed, facilitating people from underground car park.

**The eastern section of Grange Park ==has seen substantial improvements==. In the past, a pond occupied the northeastern corner. However, thoughtful redevelopment has transformed this space into a lively play area for children. ==Moving southeast,== we encounter a delightful water feature. ==Previously==, a glasshouse stood here, but it has been relocated. ==Adjacent== to the water feature, an additional entrance has been constructed. ==This entrance provides convenient access for park-goers arriving from the underground car park==.**
