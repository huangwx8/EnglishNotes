 It is argued that nobody will be willing to pay for printed newspapers and books since they will be able to access anything information they want on the Internet. This essay disagrees this opinion, and provides several reasons, from views of both providers and consumers.

Firstly, providers are changing their business strategy to adapt the digital age. PCs and smartphones have undoubtedly occupied a great portion of our daily time, therefore it will be dumb to not catch this valuable opportunity. Nowadays, a lot of famous news companies have made decisions to view Internet as their first priority. For instance, Router, a historical company in news industry, opened its account on YouTube to attract users on the Internet, meanwhile it also started providing premium online news services for those who paid for it. Circumstances are the same in book industry. In online book shops such as kindle, you still need to purchase for reading even there is no manufactural and logistic cost, respecting copyrights of the writers.

Secondly, some people still love paper-based reading. Some elders have ordered newspapers for decades, reading printed newspaper has become a habit to them, so it is predictable that many of them will continue this lifestyle, rather than turn to use digital devices. Aside from the elders, many young people prefer reading from paper too. For this group, travelling between pages and making notes are enjoyable.

In conclusion, the odds that people will discard traditional reading and read everything online is low, because providers will still try to make profits from Internet users, and there will always be some "stubborn" individuals reading paper books, even in a world full of screens.
