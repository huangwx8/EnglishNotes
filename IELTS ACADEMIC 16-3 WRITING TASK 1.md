The two maps below demonstrate a planned transformation of southwest airport.

Overall, there are three primary changes will be made. Firstly, the boarding area will be aggressively extended, with number of gates increasing from eight to eighteen and the walkway replaced with the sky train. Secondly, departure area will have a new bag drop reception in it and new shops will be developed. Thirdly, several facilities will be constructed in the arrivals region.

The most noteworthy change must be in the boarding area. Before redevelopment, this area is a quite small square and has only eight gates. However, after redevelopment, new space will be expanded to the northwest and the northeast, forming a fan shape with three blades and containing more gates, specifically eighteen.

Additionally, in departure area, cafe and check-in reception will be relocated, and the bag drop reception will be placed at where the cafe used to be, meanwhile new shops will be set up behind the security passport control. Furthermore, various facilities will be built inside arrivals region, including a new cafe, an ATM, and a car hire place.
