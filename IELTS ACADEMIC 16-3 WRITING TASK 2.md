It is argued that whether sugary food and beverage commodities should be made more expensive to discourage the public to consume them, considering their bad effects on health. This essay strongly supports this idea and presents several reasons to justify it.

**There is an ongoing debate about whether sugary food and beverage products should be made more expensive to discourage public consumption, given their adverse effects on health.**

Firstly, we must recognize that the public lacks the autonomy to get rid of sugary products. On the one hand, humans are mammals, and pursuing calories is our inherent impulse. Before civilization developed, our ancestors fought against nature, hunted and collected fruits for survival. The history inscribed the desire for sugar into our genes. On the other hand, sugary products today are designed to be attractive. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, over 70% of investigated people admitted that they thought Coca Cola is more preferable than water. Therefore, it is unrealistic for us to give up sugar by pure perseverance.

**Firstly, it is essential to recognize that the general public lacks the autonomy to eliminate sugary products. As mammals, humans have an inherent impulse to seek calories. Our ancestors, before the development of civilization, ==relied on== hunting and gathering fruits for survival, which ==ingrained== the desire for sugar in our genes. Additionally, modern sugary products are ==intentionally== designed to be appealing. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, over 70% of ==surveyed individuals== admitted that they find Coca-Cola more preferable than water. Consequently, ==expecting people to give up sugar through sheer perseverance is unrealistic.==**

Secondly, manufacturers are inclined to produce more. Modern businesses follow the principle of capitalism, which means if without restrictions, companies will always prioritize benefits over other factors, of course, including public health. In the 19th country, massive burning of fossil fuel by factories led to detrimental air pollution, which took severe tolls in cities such as London. However, factory owners did not stop it until the governments' intervene. The same circumstances can also happen in the modern sugary product industry, if not controlled appropriately, companies will try any approaches to expand sales, regardless of the negative effects on society.

**Secondly, manufacturers ==have a natural inclination to== produce more. ==In the context of modern capitalism==, businesses prioritize profits above all else, including public health. ==A historical example illustrates this==: during the 19th century, factories burned fossil fuels ==extensively==, resulting in severe air pollution that affected cities like London. Only government intervention ==compelled== factory owners to address this issue. Similarly, in the modern sugary product industry, without proper regulation, ==companies may pursue sales expansion at the expense of societal well-being.==**

In conclusion, both the consumers and the producers lack the motivation of stopping sugary product consumption, that is why the governments must act. For instance, imposing high taxes on unhealthy drinks and educating the public on healthy diets can make a good start for the betterment of society.

**In summary, ==neither== consumers ==nor== producers ==exhibit sufficient motivation== to reduce sugary product consumption. Therefore, government intervention is necessary. Implementing high taxes on unhealthy beverages and ==promoting public education about== healthy diets can serve as a positive starting point for societal improvement.**
