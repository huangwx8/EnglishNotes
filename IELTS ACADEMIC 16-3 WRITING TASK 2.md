It is argued that whether sugary food and beverage commodities should be made more expensive to discourage the public to consume them, considering their bad effects on health. This essay strongly supports this idea and presents several reasons to justify it.

Firstly, we must recognize that the public lacks the autonomy to get rid of sugary products. On the one hand, humans are mammals, and pursuing calories is our inherent impulse. Before civilization developed, our ancestors fought against nature, hunted and collected fruits for survival. The history inscribed the desire for sugar into our genes. On the other hand, sugary products today are designed to be attractive. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, over 70% of investigated people admitted that they thought Coca Cola is more preferable than water. Therefore, it is unrealistic for us to give up sugar by pure perseverance.

Secondly, manufacturers are inclined to produce more. Modern businesses follow the principle of capitalism, which means if without restrictions, companies will always prioritize benefits over other factors, of course, including public health. In the 19th country, massive burning of fossil fuel by factories led to detrimental air pollution, which took severe tolls in cities such as London. However, factory owners did not stop it until the governments' intervene. The same circumstances can also happen in the modern sugary product industry, if not controlled appropriately, companies will try any approaches to expand sales, regardless of the negative effects on society.

In conclusion, both the consumers and the producers lack the motivation of stopping sugary product consumption, that is why the governments must act. For instance, imposing high taxes on unhealthy drinks and educating the public on healthy diets can make a good start for the betterment of society.
