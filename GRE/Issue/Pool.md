1. As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.
   depends on the specific roles
   software engineers
   people who do not have the opportunities to think creatively and critically
2. To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.
   political, economic, and educational institutions differ greatly among major cities, rural towns and rural areas.
   The political system consists of national politics as a whole as well as divergences in local communities. Major cities are involved in national political activities, but citizens in a small village may think very differently about a particular issue compared to those in bit cities.
3. Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.
   Agree, school experience, unemployment issues
   opposition: schools could not possibly predict accurately
   argue: rich toolkit including score review and psychometric instruments
4. Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.
   Disagree, focus public attention on the wrong issues and can hardly maintain public attention for a sufficiently long time
   With the media always interested in reporting sensational news
   it is fairly easy for people to get away from such scandals.
   opposition: scandals are still useful in creating pressure to push the government to reform.
5. Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive. Reason: It is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated.
   government resources are limited, major cities are important sites for preserving, generating and celebrating cultural traditions, other areas are equally important in many countries
   major cities can receive support from different financial sources such as advertising, donation of city residents and big corporations
6. A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.
   Agree, useful for college admission, helpful for students from less developed regions, but be careful about government intervention
7. Some people believe that government funding of the arts is necessary to ensure that the arts can flourish and be available to all people. Others believe that government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.
   many artworks could not attract a large number of audience who are willing to pay a large amount of money
   the government always has the incentives to sponsor arts that may help advance its own political agenda
   create an independent commission that distributes government funding in a politically neutral way
8. Claim: In any field—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years. 
   Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.
   business/educational do not benefit, but politicians should.
   prevent power abuse and revitalize the organizations.
   business leader, accumulate more experience while working with the staff to develop the best strategic plans for the long-term development of a company
   One may argue that just like corporate CEOs and university presidents, it also takes years for a government official to learn to do his/her job well and build his/her reputation. The risk of having a dictator justifies the cost of reducing the tenure of a capable leader.
9. In any field of endeavor, it is impossible to make a significant contribution without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field.
   common law, refer to earlier rulings
   software, reuse infrastructure
   policy maker, case by case
10. Nations should pass laws to preserve any remaining wilderness areas in their natural state, even if these areas could be developed for economic gain.
	for nations where people are fighting against poverty, this policy should not be adopted 
	for nations where people need more land for basic needs such as housing, this policy is not sensible 
	for nations which are well-developed, a conservation program rather than preservation program should be introduced
11. People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.
    Industrialization can certainly increase the productivity and reduce errors, there is little room for them to make their own decisions about their behaviors.
    Numerous strategies like these have been employed by corporations to lure more customers to buy things we do not really need and to spend money we have not yet earned.
    we can still try to fight for our freedom as we learn more about how our behaviors have been influenced by external forces
12. Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.
    consequences for universities, students, society.
    With the limited resources available in the university, e.g. study space and faculty members, the quality of university education will be compromised.
    Students may be tempted to provide misleading or fraudulent information about their financial situation in order to get free university education. they may lose the momentum to work hard during their studies as they do not have to worry about paying back their student loan after graduation.
    less financial resources will be available for other members of the society who may deserve more attention or care from the government.
13. Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.
    Agree, benefit one’s academic study, development of citizenship as well as future career. taking courses from related disciplines can help student to study their own majors more effectively
    Science and technology majors can better understand the current debates on different political issues by taking courses in history, economics and political science.
	universities are not merely vocational training schools.
14. A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

15. Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.
    Disagree, To get a well-paid job and a successful career requires a combination of many things including a good degree with solid knowledge, a booming industry in which the graduates work, good interpersonal skills and a large amount of luck.
    Without genuine interests in the field but driven by the extrinsic motivation from the promise of future “lucrative” careers, the students may find it difficult to understand the materials or commit themselves to the studies
    opposition: alumni with higher income donations, reputation. possibility, willingness.
16. Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.
    government officials should consult the public frequently and systematically before introducing important policies. 
    members of the public are often notoriously ill-informed on some important issues, especially when it comes to science and technology.
17. Formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.
    primary and secondary level, restraining the minds and spirits to some extent is necessary for students to focus on their studies and acquire the basic skills and knowledge they need for further education.
    At universities, students are free to choose different courses and explore their own interests. They can think more liberally and do their own original researches to create new knowledge. They can also think critically about the different theories. 
    But these intellectual activities are not possible without the solid foundation laid at earlier stages
    funding of the government may compromise the political neutrality of teachers
18. The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.
    different groups, military, research.
    The authority of the commanders has to be maintained to ensure that the army would perform according to the commands made by the top management.
    challenging the authority of one another ensures the rigor of science and the validity of knowledge construction. new theories can be developed and new technologies can be advanced
19. Governments should focus on solving the immediate problems of today rather than on trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.
    Local/Federal governments
    Local governments should commit themselves to solving immediate problems because they have more local knowledge and resources
    Federal governments, on the other hand, should develop long-term solutions for the nation. better competence for structural problems, replication more economically feasible and effective for the federal government to focus on future problems.
20. Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field of study. Others believe that college students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.
    Disagree, one cannot reliably predict the availability of jobs in a given field. students are less likely to perform well in their studies without genuine interest in the subject matters.
21. Laws should be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.
    Constitutional law does not need to be very flexible to take account of different kinds of factors because the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and legislature, and judiciary.
    State law, which is the law of each separate U.S. state, should be flexible to take account of characteristics in different places.
22. Claim: The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its role models. Reason: Heroes and role models reveal a society's highest ideals.
    heroes and role models are chosen by the powerful elite, people can be easily influenced by propaganda.
    this proposed method is not unique. with the ubiquitousness of social media and the resulting availability of the big data about ordinary people, it is also fairly easy to understand behaviors of ordinary people.
23. Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.
    As Thomas Paine famously put it, “Government, even in its best form, is a necessary evil.” We allow the government to take away part of our freedom and property (via taxation) because some form of government is necessary to maintain the social order. 
    the principle of academic freedom, which is the core values of higher education, also dictates that the government should allow maximum freedom for the scientists and researchers to pursue any projects they are interested in.
    research projects nowadays often have to go through lengthy processes of funding applications during which experts will evaluate the potential benefits and harms of the research. by funding agencies and ethical review committees.
24. The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
    There is no doubt that praising positive actions or behaviours is the best way to teach students, children and employees as the positive reinforcement will lead to repetition of more desirable behaviours. While some people may emphasise the importance of correcting mistakes, I believe that incorrect actions will be gradually replaced by correct actions which receive positive feedback.
25. Governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students.
26. The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.
    automobile facilitates life, but damage physical health.
    online videos enrich life, but detriment critical thinking.
    luxuries and conveniences can help us become economically strong. On the other hand, they may prevent us from developing our physical strength and spiritual independence.
27. In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.
    It is true that beginners may be more energetic, but the experts are often better skilled.
    the experts have more resources in their disposal. Experts usually get more funding from the governments or other foundations than beginners because the experts had a record of successful projects that can predict their future success of the next project.
28. The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.
    welfare cannot serve as a reliable indicator. Maybe the nation is endowed with rich natural resources, or by plundering other countries.
    exceptional leaders in the fields of politics, art and science had achieved great works that can benefit not just their compatriots but the people all over the world.
29. The best way to teach—whether as an educator, employer, or parent—is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
    children and employees as the positive reinforcement will lead to repetition of more desirable behaviours. 
    While some people may emphasise the importance of correcting mistakes, I believe that incorrect actions will be gradually replaced by correct actions which receive positive feedback.
30. Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.
    prevent the students from developing in a well-rounded manner
    prevent the students from learning knowledge
    opposition: incentives, unfair due to background difference. students’ academic performance is affected by multiple factors
31. Society should make efforts to save endangered species only if the potential extinction of those species is the result of human activities.
    If this criterion were adopted as part of the policy, the government agencies and the scientists would have a hard time to decide whether or not the potential extinction of certain species is due to human activities or not.
    Some species have great potential to produce substance with important pharmaceutical and other scientific value and should be preserved with great efforts.
    another reason against the proposed policy is that new technologies have made it possible for scientists to build a gene bank to preserve all the endangered species in a rather inexpensive way.
32. College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.
33. As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious.
    depend on which groups of people we are talking about here. 
    For the general public, science has provided solutions and resolved puzzles, enabled us to understand events in the world with confidence. (germ, relativity)
    For the scientific researchers, however, science is far less certain and settled, creating more complex puzzles than anyone can possibly solve completely. (financial crisis)
34. In any situation, progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view.
    In diplomatic field, governments of different counties usually have different opinions. Negotiation is necessary to reach the final settlement.
    In political field, we can hear voices from different social classes. Only hearing working class results in populism, while only hearing elite class causes autocracy.
    In scientific field, especially fields such as physics and social science, arguments is never rare since our observation is vague and hard to understand. Fierce collision between contrasting minds leads to scientific progress.
35. Educational institutions should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.
36. Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.
	For those projects that may lead to commercial applications or ethical crisis, the government should not spend taxpayers’ money on them. (driverless cars, clone)
	But for those theoretical research projects with no clear practical value, government support is essential. (theoretical physics)
37. Society should identify those children who have special talents and provide training for them at an early age to develop their talents.
    In mathematics and science, society can identify those children who have special talents by competitions and should provide them with special training because the children may contribute to the fields greatly. (benefits humanity)
    Nevertheless, for children talented in sports, it is ethically problematic to identify and train them at an early age. (against their wills, very few eventually win medals)
38. It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.
    agree that we need to participate in different social communities in order to construct our identities, interacting with our parents, partners and children in private relationships is also an essential aspect of our identities.
    nationality or citizenship (language, culture, political activities)
    institutions, specifically universities (educational experiences)
    parents, our partners and our children (emotional joy, express ourselves liberally)
39. College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs.
40. Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students. Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.
41. The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.
	Agree, political leaders, writers (contemporaries are usually partial, long-term implication)
	Disagree, scientists and athletes (well defined criteria can be applied on sports events and scientific achievements)
42. Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.
    accepted facts and theories should not be questioned (verified scientifically)
    values and ideologies should be questioned (propaganda and brainwash)
43. The increasingly rapid pace of life today causes more problems than it solves.
    rapid pace: traffic, communication, police and hospital
    shortcoming: health and psychological problems
    argue: vacations, exercise
44. Claim: It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.
    Reason: The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will eventually be diminished.
    entertainment and sports: young, talented and wealthy, temptations, scandals.
    politics: political enemies.
    science: benefits the public
    fame and wealth accompanied by attention and attacks, unavoidable.
45. Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.
    In elementary schools, should spend more time playing and experimenting with different ideas and objects in order to cultivate creativity rather than memorizing and practicing for exams
	In universities, need to develop skills and techniques that are important in the real world, where people often collaborate in teams rather than work individually.
    In middle schools, students have to demonstrate their academic potential through strong performance in their high schools.
46. Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.
47. Educators should find out what students want included in the curriculum and then offer it to them.
48. Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts.
    depends on the reasons why the facts have to be taught in the particular educational contexts as well as the learning abilities of the students.
    solve problems: fact itself is very useful, no need to explain. (Pythagorean theorem)
    immature students: incapable of understanding ideas.
    contentious social and political problems: develop more balanced view.
49. Claim: We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from those whose views contradict our own. Reason: Disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.
    we can learn more from those holding different views as long as our relationships enable us to discuss and exchange viewpoints in a rational and equal manner. (colleagues and classmates)
    both the claim and the reason hold true when we could not stay calm and reasonable, e.g. fighting with spouses or political rivals.
50. Government officials should rely on their own judgment rather than unquestioningly carry out the will of the people they serve.
51. Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition.
    depends on the careers they plan to pursue.
    entertainment and sports: short career lifespan, demands for resources (being famous).
    academic research: long time to acquire basic knowledge, significant efforts to make breakthrough.
    politics: meet more people from diverse age groups and classes.
52. The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
53. If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it are justifiable.
    cost too much (railway).
    unjust in procedure (torture to extract information)
    ethically problematic (user data privacy)
54. In order to become well-rounded individuals, all college students should be required to take courses in which they read poetry, novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature.
    expose issues that concern humanity as a whole.
    foster creativity.
    requirement provides incentives (internet temptations).
    guidance and course design.
55. In order for any work of art—for example, a film, a novel, a poem, or a song—to have merit, it must be understandable to most people.
    cultural barriers (Journey to the west)
	generation gap (Anime)
	political factors (1984)
56. Many important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.
    discovery of New World (dramatic and rare).
    knowledge are constructed in a systematic way (geology is complete nowadays).
    research sponsor expect certain type of outcome.
57. The main benefit of the study of history is to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times.
    actually different (technology, political system, culture).
    main benefit: do better in the modern world.
    learn from mistake (World War II)
58. Learning is primarily a matter of personal discipline; students cannot be motivated by school or college alone.
    Primary school students: driven to learn by interest, explore fields.
    Secondary school students: is personal discipline, but school is a strong force (incentives, competition).
    College students: not only learning (cooperate, research), responsible for their own decisions.
59. Scientists and other researchers should focus their research on areas that are likely to benefit the greatest number of people.
    researchers in engineering: solve problems that bothers most people, maximize productivity (power grid, internet)
    natural scientists: discover meaning of humanity (big bang theory), unpredictable potential (nuclear energy).
    Social scientists: address problems of people who is the most needy.
60. Politicians should pursue common ground and reasonable consensus rather than elusive ideals.
    Mao Zedong: unrealistic political ideals (eliminate classes), Great Leap Forward, millions of people died from starvation during the three-year famine.
    Deng Xiaoping: find a consensus - economic development.
