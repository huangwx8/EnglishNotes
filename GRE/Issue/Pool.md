1. 1.As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.
   depends on the specific roles
   software engineers
   people who do not have the opportunities to think creatively and critically
2. To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.
   political, economic, and educational institutions differ greatly among major cities, rural towns and rural areas.
   The political system consists of national politics as a whole as well as divergences in local communities. Major cities are involved in national political activities, but citizens in a small village may think very differently about a particular issue compared to those in bit cities.
3. Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.
   Agree, school experience, unemployment issues
   opposition: schools could not possibly predict accurately
   argue: rich toolkit including score review and psychometric instruments
4. Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.
   Disagree, focus public attention on the wrong issues and can hardly maintain public attention for a sufficiently long time
   With the media always interested in reporting sensational news
   it is fairly easy for people to get away from such scandals.
   opposition: scandals are still useful in creating pressure to push the government to reform.
5. Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive. Reason: It is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated.
   government resources are limited, major cities are important sites for preserving, generating and celebrating cultural traditions, other areas are equally important in many countries
   major cities can receive support from different financial sources such as advertising, donation of city residents and big corporations
6. A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.
   Agree, useful for college admission, helpful for students from less developed regions, but be careful about government intervention
7. Some people believe that government funding of the arts is necessary to ensure that the arts can flourish and be available to all people. Others believe that government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.
   many artworks could not attract a large number of audience who are willing to pay a large amount of money
   the government always has the incentives to sponsor arts that may help advance its own political agenda
   create an independent commission that distributes government funding in a politically neutral way
8. Claim: In any field—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years. 
   Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.
   business/educational do not benefit, but politicians should.
   prevent power abuse and revitalize the organizations.
   business leader, accumulate more experience while working with the staff to develop the best strategic plans for the long-term development of a company
   One may argue that just like corporate CEOs and university presidents, it also takes years for a government official to learn to do his/her job well and build his/her reputation. The risk of having a dictator justifies the cost of reducing the tenure of a capable leader.
9. In any field of endeavor, it is impossible to make a significant contribution without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field.
   common law, refer to earlier rulings
   software, reuse infrastructure
   policy maker, case by case
10. Nations should pass laws to preserve any remaining wilderness areas in their natural state, even if these areas could be developed for economic gain.
	for nations where people are fighting against poverty, this policy should not be adopted 
	for nations where people need more land for basic needs such as housing, this policy is not sensible 
	for nations which are well-developed, a conservation program rather than preservation program should be introduced
11. People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.
    Industrialization can certainly increase the productivity and reduce errors, there is little room for them to make their own decisions about their behaviors.
    Numerous strategies like these have been employed by corporations to lure more customers to buy things we do not really need and to spend money we have not yet earned.
    we can still try to fight for our freedom as we learn more about how our behaviors have been influenced by external forces
12. Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.
    consequences for universities, students, society.
    With the limited resources available in the university, e.g. study space and faculty members, the quality of university education will be compromised.
    Students may be tempted to provide misleading or fraudulent information about their financial situation in order to get free university education. they may lose the momentum to work hard during their studies as they do not have to worry about paying back their student loan after graduation.
    less financial resources will be available for other members of the society who may deserve more attention or care from the government.
13. Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.
    Agree, benefit one’s academic study, development of citizenship as well as future career. taking courses from related disciplines can help student to study their own majors more effectively
    Science and technology majors can better understand the current debates on different political issues by taking courses in history, economics and political science.
	universities are not merely vocational training schools.
14. A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

15. Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.
    Disagree, To get a well-paid job and a successful career requires a combination of many things including a good degree with solid knowledge, a booming industry in which the graduates work, good interpersonal skills and a large amount of luck.
    Without genuine interests in the field but driven by the extrinsic motivation from the promise of future “lucrative” careers, the students may find it difficult to understand the materials or commit themselves to the studies
    opposition: alumni with higher income donations, reputation. possibility, willingness.
16. Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.
    government officials should consult the public frequently and systematically before introducing important policies. 
    members of the public are often notoriously ill-informed on some important issues, especially when it comes to science and technology.
17. Formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.
    primary and secondary level, restraining the minds and spirits to some extent is necessary for students to focus on their studies and acquire the basic skills and knowledge they need for further education.
    At universities, students are free to choose different courses and explore their own interests. They can think more liberally and do their own original researches to create new knowledge. They can also think critically about the different theories. 
    But these intellectual activities are not possible without the solid foundation laid at earlier stages
    funding of the government may compromise the political neutrality of teachers
18. The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.
    different groups, military, research.
    The authority of the commanders has to be maintained to ensure that the army would perform according to the commands made by the top management.
    challenging the authority of one another ensures the rigor of science and the validity of knowledge construction. new theories can be developed and new technologies can be advanced
19. Governments should focus on solving the immediate problems of today rather than on trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.
    Local/Federal governments
    Local governments should commit themselves to solving immediate problems because they have more local knowledge and resources
    Federal governments, on the other hand, should develop long-term solutions for the nation. better competence for structural problems, replication more economically feasible and effective for the federal government to focus on future problems.
20. Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field of study. Others believe that college students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.
    Disagree, one cannot reliably predict the availability of jobs in a given field. students are less likely to perform well in their studies without genuine interest in the subject matters.
21. Laws should be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.
    Constitutional law does not need to be very flexible to take account of different kinds of factors because the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and legislature, and judiciary.
    State law, which is the law of each separate U.S. state, should be flexible to take account of characteristics in different places.
22. Claim: The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its role models. Reason: Heroes and role models reveal a society's highest ideals.
    heroes and role models are chosen by the powerful elite, people can be easily influenced by propaganda.
    this proposed method is not unique. with the ubiquitousness of social media and the resulting availability of the big data about ordinary people, it is also fairly easy to understand behaviors of ordinary people.
23. Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.
    As Thomas Paine famously put it, “Government, even in its best form, is a necessary evil.” We allow the government to take away part of our freedom and property (via taxation) because some form of government is necessary to maintain the social order. 
    the principle of academic freedom, which is the core values of higher education, also dictates that the government should allow maximum freedom for the scientists and researchers to pursue any projects they are interested in.
    research projects nowadays often have to go through lengthy processes of funding applications during which experts will evaluate the potential benefits and harms of the research. by funding agencies and ethical review committees.
24. The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
    There is no doubt that praising positive actions or behaviours is the best way to teach students, children and employees as the positive reinforcement will lead to repetition of more desirable behaviours. While some people may emphasise the importance of correcting mistakes, I believe that incorrect actions will be gradually replaced by correct actions which receive positive feedback.
25. Governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students.
26. The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.
    automobile facilitates life, but damage physical health.
    online videos enrich life, but detriment critical thinking.
    luxuries and conveniences can help us become economically strong. On the other hand, they may prevent us from developing our physical strength and spiritual independence.
27. In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.
    It is true that beginners may be more energetic, but the experts are often better skilled.
    the experts have more resources in their disposal. Experts usually get more funding from the governments or other foundations than beginners because the experts had a record of successful projects that can predict their future success of the next project.
28. The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.
    welfare cannot serve as a reliable indicator. Maybe the nation is endowed with rich natural resources, or by plundering other countries.
    exceptional leaders in the fields of politics, art and science had achieved great works that can benefit not just their compatriots but the people all over the world.
29. The best way to teach—whether as an educator, employer, or parent—is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.
30. Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.
    prevent the students from developing in a well-rounded manner
    prevent the students from learning knowledge
    opposition: incentives, unfair due to background difference. students’ academic performance is affected by multiple factors
