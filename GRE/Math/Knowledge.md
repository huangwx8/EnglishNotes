1. Constants of standard distribution
   0.6827, 0.9545, 0.9973
2. Quadratic equation solution
   $(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}) / 2a$
3. Sin/Cos/Tan
   sin(0) = 0, sin(30) = 1/2, sin(45) = $\sqrt 2/2$, sin(60) = $\sqrt 3/2$, sin(90) = 1
   cos(x) = sin(90-x)
   tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)
4. odd times odd is odd, even times even is even, even times odd is even
5. units digit of $a\times b$ is only determined by their units digits
6. 1 is not a prime number, 2 is a prime number
7. "prime factors" = "different prime factors"
8. a^2+ b^2 < c^2 = obtuse triangle
9. a^2+ b^2 > c^2 = acute triangle
10. $p = (a+b+c)/2$, $S=\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}$
11. given a perimeter, equilateral triangle has the largest area
12. circle angle = 0.5 central angle
13.  $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$
14. mutually exclusive = $p(A \cap B) = 0$ 
15. independent = $p(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$
