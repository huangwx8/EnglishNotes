There is an ongoing debate about whether music is capable of gathering people from distinct cultures and ages together. This essay strongly supports this perspective and will provide several reasons to justify it.

Firstly, music has shown its power to spread across cultures. With the advent of instruments, voice was no longer the necessary media to convey extraordinary music. Take piano for example, nowadays almost every music school has piano class, teaching how to play renowned masterpieces written by great musicians such as Mozart, despite they are from different cultures. Furthermore, music with human voices can also penetrate language barrier. A case at point is "Despacito" composed by Justin Bieber, which was written in Spanish, gained amazing popularity in numerous non Spanish speaking countries. It exemplified how powerful music is, even people listening to it can not understand the meaning of the lyrics, they can still grab the emotion composers want to express.

**Music ==transcends== cultural boundaries. For instance, the piano—an instrument originating from European classical music—has become a global phenomenon. Music schools worldwide teach students how to play masterpieces by composers like Mozart, regardless of their cultural backgrounds. Additionally, songs like “Despacito” demonstrate how music ==bridges== language ==gaps==. Although the lyrics are in Spanish, the ==catchy== ==melody== and ==rhythm== ==resonated with== audiences worldwide. People may not understand the words, but they still connect with the emotions conveyed.**

Secondly, music can be equally enjoyed by different age groups. The Wall Street Journal reported an intriguing phenomena: Elders contribute to 15% of pop music album purchases. From traditional viewpoint, pop music is usually favored by the teenagers exclusively, but the statistics exhibits an astonishing result - old people also enjoy it. If we consider the classic music, the distribution in age is more even. It is so common that we can see both people over 70 and under 10 appear in a same concert!

**The Wall Street Journal’s findings are fascinating. Pop music, often ==associated with== ==youth==, attracts a surprising number of older listeners. This ==challenges== the ==stereotype== that only teenagers enjoy pop music. In fact, classic music also ==appeals to== a diverse age range. Concerts provide a vivid illustration of this. Attendees span generations, from children to ==seniors==. Music’s universal appeal brings people together, ==regardless of== age.**

From ancient time, when our ancestors did not know how to speak, they used the pitch of voices to distinguish companions and enemies. Maybe that makes us modern humans inherently sensitive to music, and explains our unconditional love for it.

**Our ancestors used voice pitch to communicate even before language developed. This sensitivity to music may explain our ==unwavering== love for it. ==Whether through classical compositions, contemporary hits, or folk tunes, music resonates within us, fostering connections beyond words.==**
