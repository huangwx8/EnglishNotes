On the other hand, as the growth of capitalism and information technology, advertising are everywhere in modern lives. Commercials have become cheaper and ubiquitous, thus we can not easily be amazed by a novel commercial video on TV. This phenomenon leads to questioning voices: people watch dozens of commercials from streets, TVs, YouTube each day, and there are thousands of high-quality commodities in supermarkets, so why should I make purchase just due to one commercial?

In my opinion, the power of advertising is not as great as it used to be, but it is still a necessary part of business operation. Undoubtedly, as a businessman, there are more competitors manufacturing and advertising than before, but that is not the reason to stop advertising.

A living example is TicTok, a short video company, recently developed a new advertising mode, streaming-sale, manufacturers recruit famous influencers to represent advantages of commodities in streaming. This mode is successful because this mode is more interactive, and can easily catch watchers' eyeballs.
