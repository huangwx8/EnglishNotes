**The bar chart illustrates how families in one state allocated their weekly income to different spending categories in 1968 and 2018.**

It is prominent that food was the primary cost for families in 1968, while other categories were all insignificant. Another noteworthy feature is food no longer being the highest spending in 2018, instead, it was taken over by leisure and housing.

In 1968, families paid a lot for food, with the percentage of food in weekly income being 35%, three times higher than all others. "Housing" and "Clothing and footwear" were the two second highest items, which only took 10%.

**In 1968, families ==allocated a significant portion of== their income ==to== food, with the percentage spent on food ==accounting for== 35%, which was three times higher than all other categories. “Housing” and “Clothing and footwear” were the second-highest items, each accounting for only 10%.**

However, allocation had changed by 2018. Proportion of food had dropped dramatically, from previous 35% to just over 15%. Decrease in food was offset by the increases in leisure and housing, which were the highest and the second highest at that time. The growth in leisure was the sharpest among all categories, from less than 10% to about 22%.
