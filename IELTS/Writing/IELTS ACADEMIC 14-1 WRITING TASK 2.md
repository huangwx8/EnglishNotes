It is argued that how should we deal with a terrible circumstance, some believe we should accept it, while others think making some improvement is better. This essay delves these two perspectives, and try to justify the latter one.

**The question of how to approach challenging circumstances ==has intrigued humanity for centuries==. Some argue that ==acceptance== is the key, while others ==advocate for== proactive improvement. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives and argue ==in favor of== the latter.**

For the first opinion, it is common that people always have to face undesirable situations, such as financial shortage and physical inconvenience. A sad truth is: sometimes these situations last a long time, no matter how hard you try to escape. For instance, there is no cure for some tricky diseases, like genetic diabetes, some people may have to live their whole lives with it. In this case, accepting becomes the only choice. For unfortunate individuals who have genetic diabetes, learning the way to coexist with it makes them live better, struggling does not.

**It is ==undeniable== that life often throws us into undesirable situations. Financial ==hardships==, physical limitations, and incurable diseases are just a few examples. Sometimes, ==despite our best efforts==, these circumstances ==persist indefinitely==. Take, for instance, genetic diabetes—a condition that ==afflicts== many individuals. For those unfortunate enough to ==bear this burden==, acceptance becomes the only ==viable== option. Learning to coexist with the disease rather than constantly struggling against it can lead to a better quality of life.**

As for the second standpoint, fighting against adversities is actually most people do. There are numerous stories of people who survived the worst scenarios and succeeded. As exemplified by GuangYao Lee, the first president of Singapore. At his time, the country was messy. Governments were inefficient, industry was stale, and most of citizens did not received education. Lee then imposed a lot of critical reforms over the next decades, although faced with many obstacles which other politicians thought "impossible". Nevertheless, his actions is surprisingly successfully. Today, Singapore is a wealthy developed country with high quality population, and Lee deserves most of credits for it.

**==On the other hand==, countless stories throughout history demonstrate humanity’s resilience ==in the face of== adversity. Consider the remarkable journey of GuangYao Lee, the first president of Singapore. During his tenure, Singapore was grappling with inefficiencies in governance, a ==stagnant economy==, and ==widespread== lack of education. Lee, undeterred by seemingly insurmountable obstacles, ==embarked on a mission== of critical reforms. His actions were ==met with== ==skepticism== from other politicians who ==deemed== them “impossible.” Yet, against all odds, Lee’s vision and determination prevailed. Today, Singapore stands as a ==prosperous==, developed nation with a high-quality population—a ==testament== to Lee’s ==unwavering commitment to== improvement.**

As far as i am concerned, in modern world, people can get rid of many bad circumstances by conviction and perseverance, except some worst cases mentioned above. Technology has reshaped the earth, and social mobility is also high thanks for it. With advanced technology, humanity can survive even in the worst disasters including earthquake and tsunami. In addition, booming economies provide millions of opportunities, a student from poor family can still get a collage degree and find a decent job. Difficulty is often not the excuse, and evasion is also not the solution.

**In our ==rapidly evolving world==, the interplay of conviction, perseverance, and technological advancements has reshaped the way we navigate challenges. While some situations remain insurmountable, many can be overcome through sheer determination and effort. Advanced technology has ==revolutionized== our ability to ==cope with== disasters. Earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural calamities no longer spell inevitable doom. Social mobility, a hallmark of modern societies, enables individuals to transcend their circumstances. Booming economies create pathways for upward mobility. Consider a student ==from a humble background==: ==armed with== ==determination== and access to education, they can earn a college degree and secure meaningful employment. Economic opportunities abound, ==bridging gaps== and ==empowering== individuals to rise above adversity.**

Therefore when you are in some harsh situation, before you think it is impossible to overcome, try to make some efforts, your efforts will usually become worth in the future.

**In this intricate tapestry of existence, our choices matter. Let us embrace challenges, celebrate progress, and extend a helping hand. Together, we can ==weave a brighter future==—one where ==conviction, perseverance, and compassion== prevail.**
