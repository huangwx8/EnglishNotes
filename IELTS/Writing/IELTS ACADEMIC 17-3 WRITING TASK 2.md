Nowadays, it is argued that practitioners in professional fields should only be allowed to work in the countries where they received training, while some other people think that they have rights to work in any countries if they want. This essay agrees with the latter opinions, and provides some reasons to justify it.

**In todayâ€™s world, there is an ==ongoing debate about== whether professionals should be restricted to working only in the countries where they received their training. However, this essay ==aligns with== the ==viewpoint== that individuals have the right to work in any country they choose, and I will present reasons to support this stance.**

In modern world, the first view has gained considerable popularity, and the main reason public argues may be the damage to developing countries. Undoubtedly, losing professionals is harmful to the economy of the countries where professionals were educated. Considering the fact that most of these countries are developing countries, the damage would be even worse. Take China for example, thousands of collage students left China after graduated, going to other developed countries such as United States, where they can enjoy better salaries and lives. Nevertheless, this phenomenon will continuously increase the economic difference between China and developed countries, thus exaggerate the phenomenon itself, forming a negative loop.

**==In the contemporary global landscape==, the first perspective has gained significant traction. Advocates of this view often ==highlight== the potential harm to developing countries. Undoubtedly, the ==loss== of skilled professionals ==adversely== affects the ==economies== of the countries where they received their education. ==Given that== many of these nations are still in the process of development, the impact becomes even more pronounced. For instance, consider China: thousands of college graduates leave the country to pursue better opportunities abroad, ==particularly== in developed nations like the United States. Unfortunately, this trend perpetuates the economic ==disparity== between China and more advanced countries, creating a detrimental cycle.**

The second view was the primary trend over the last decades, when the globalization was unstoppable. Governments and companies believed increasing international cooperations and global trade would benefits each sides. Coca Cola, the well-known drink company, has sold its products across the globe since WW-II, and some of its managers and staff moved to other countries simultaneously. Migration of capitals and people has created new jobs, and significantly improved the life qualities of both international workers and local residents.

**The second perspective ==gained prominence== during ==the past few decades==, ==especially== in the era of unstoppable globalization. Governments and corporations alike embraced the idea that enhanced international cooperation and global trade would ==yield mutual benefits==. ==A case in point== is Coca-Cola, the ==renowned== beverage company, which has successfully marketed its products worldwide since World War II. Additionally, some of its managers and staff have ==relocated== to other countries ==as part of== this global expansion. ==Consequently==, the movement of capital and people has ==not only== generated new employment opportunities ==but== has ==also== markedly improved the ==quality of life== for both international workers and local communities.**

In my opinion, the importance of allowing working abroad largely overweighs its disadvantages. Aside from the economic factors, there is one thing which is the first priority - human rights. Freedom of migrating is one of the intrinsic rights of humans, and should be respected no matter what. Forcing people to stay in their native countries, is a humiliation to humans' free will, and will reduce the productivity of the whole society in long term. If governments care the lose, they should improve the living condition and working environment, but not by law.

**In my view, the ==benefits== of permitting work abroad ==far surpass== the ==drawbacks==. ==Beyond== economic ==considerations==, the ==fundamental issue at stake== is human rights. The freedom to migrate is an ==inherent== right for all individuals, and it should be ==upheld== ==unconditionally==. ==Coercing== people to remain in their native countries ==undermines== their ==autonomy== and ultimately ==hampers== overall ==societal== productivity in the long run. If governments ==genuinely== seek to ==address== this loss, they ==ought to== focus on ==enhancing== living ==conditions== and work environments ==rather than== relying ==solely== on ==legislation==.**
