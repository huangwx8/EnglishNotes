In addition, two new housing areas will be built, with one situated to the west of the park, and the other one standing at the end of a sideway out of the eastern junction of the carriageway. What is more exciting is the redevelopment in the northwest. Shops in the north will be fully removed, giving way to a new bus station, a new shopping center and a new car park.
