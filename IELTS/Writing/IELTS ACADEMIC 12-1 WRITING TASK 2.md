There is an ongoing debate about whether we should share information in research and industry  with others selflessly. This essay argues that its drawbacks outweigh its benefits, and presents some reasons for it.

**There is an ongoing debate about whether we should selflessly share information in research and industry. This essay argues that the drawbacks of such sharing outweigh its benefits and presents several reasons to ==support this viewpoint==.**

First of all, excessive sharing discourages creation. One undeniable human nature is: people need incentives to make progress, both in research and business worlds. Take oil industry as example, in the early 20th century when people just discovered oil, the technique we used to extract and store oil ~~is~~ extremely primitive and ineffective. The oil giants immediately recognized it, then fierce technological competition started because increase in production led to growth in profits. Over the following 20 years, these giants invested millions of dollars in research, making the production almost 100 times than before! If all technologies were shared between them, this incentive would not exist, because the progress you made would conversely help your opponents and suppress your profits in turn.

**Firstly, excessive sharing discourages ==innovation==. It is an undeniable aspect of human nature that people require incentives to make progress, both in research and business contexts.

Over the subsequent 20 years, these giants invested millions of dollars in research, resulting in production levels nearly 100 times higher than before! If all technologies ==had been openly shared== among them, this incentive ==would have vanished==, as progress made by one party would inadvertently benefit competitors and suppress profits.**

Secondly, shared information can be used by evil individuals. Although most of scientific progress in history has improved our society, occasionally it can be utilized to do bad things. A case in point is the weaponization of chlorine. The invention of the chlorine ~~separate~~ technique is initially good, which can be used to kill germs in water, and significantly improved the quality of drink water. However, during the World War I, some German scientists weaponized it, invented a chemical gas and deployed it in the battle fields, killing millions of lives. The sharing of technology was out of good purpose, but resulted in a disastrous outcome.

**Secondly, shared information can ==fall into the wrong hands==. While scientific progress has generally improved society, there are instances where it has been ==misused==. Consider the weaponization of chlorine as ==an== example. Initially, the chlorine separation technique was developed for beneficial purposesâ€”it could effectively kill germs in water, significantly improving water quality. However, during World War I, German scientists weaponized it, creating a chemical gas that was deployed ==on the battlefield==, resulting in the loss of millions of lives. Although the initial sharing of this technology had good intentions, it ultimately had devastating consequences.**

In conclusion, sharing information suppresses passion of researchers as well as scientists, and risks the possibility of being used for evil intention. Therefore, I believe that restriction to some extent is necessary, both for contemporary society, and future generations

**In conclusion, widespread information sharing can dampen the passion of researchers and scientists, and it also ==carries the risk of== being ==exploited== for nefarious purposes. Consequently, I believe that imposing certain restrictions is essential for both contemporary society and future generations.**
