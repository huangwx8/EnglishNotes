The two charts demonstrate one country's changes of percentage of households owning three main electrical appliances, and how many hours per household needed to do housework in one week, over the period from 1920 to 2019.

**The two charts demonstrate one countryâ€™s ==changes in== the percentage of households owning three main electrical appliances and ==the number of hour== per household needed to do housework in one week from 1920 to 2019.**

Overall, it is clear that all the three electrical appliances displayed in the first chart entered more and more families, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners even went up to 100% in 2000. However, we can easily see that the average housework time dropped continuously in the second chart.

**Overall, it is clear that all three electrical appliances displayed in the first chart ==became increasingly common in households==; refrigerators and vacuum cleaners even reached 100% ownership ==by 2000==. However, we can easily see that the average housework time dropped continuously in the second chart.**

In the first chart, the most significant growth among three electrical appliance types is that of refrigerators, the percentage of refrigerators in 1920 is a tiny fraction, but during 1920 and 1960, the increase is so rapid, and in 1980 the percentage is already around 100%. Meanwhile, the growth of vacuum cleaners is steady, from about 30% percent in 1920 to nearly 100% in 2000. However, the trend of washing machines is not as good as the other two, the percentage only increased by roughly a quarter.

In the second chart, the housework time decreased from 50% in 1920, to just over 10% in 2019. The most steep drop happened during 1920 to 1960, exactly overlapping period when the dramatic growth of refrigerators occurred, with a 30% fall.
