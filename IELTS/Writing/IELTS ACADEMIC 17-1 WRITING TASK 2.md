It is argued that taking risks is important to people, both in their careers and daily lives. This essay agrees that the advantages of taking risks outweigh the disadvantages. Firstly, good opportunities are usually associated with high risks; Secondly, people can become more resilient by taking risks.

**It is argued that taking risks is important to us in both our careers and daily lives. This essay strongly supports the idea that the ==benefits== of taking risks far outweigh the ==drawbacks==. There are two primary reasons for this ==perspective==.**

One witness used to say: "No pain, no gain", which well explained the relationship between opportunities and risks. Thousands years ago, when humans made a living by hunting, our ancestors had already known it. If they wanted to feed themselves and tribes well, they would have to hunt vicious preys like bulls and elephants, otherwise they would starve. Nowadays, this law remains unchanged. For example, according to The Wall Street Journal, more than 20,000 people built startups in technology sector from 2000 to 2020, but only a few went public, the rest of them ended up with closing down or bankruptcy. But these successors entirely changed the world, Google created the biggest searching engine, Tesla manufactured millions of EVs each year, They pushed out society forward, without the spirit of taking risks, humans cannot go that far.

**Firstly, opportunities are often ==intertwined== with risks. ==Throughout history==, humans have recognized this connection. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors relied on hunting for survival. To feed themselves and their tribes, they had to confront formidable prey such as bulls and elephants. The same principle applies today. Consider the technology sector: more than 20,000 people ==established== startups between 2000 and 2020. While only a few of these ventures went public, the rest ==faced closure or bankruptcy==. Nevertheless, these risk-takers transformed the world. Google ==revolutionized== search engines, and Tesla now produces millions of electric vehicles ==annually==. Progress hinges on the willingness to take risks.**

Many people are not willing to take risks, because they always think about the possibility of failure. But there is one thing they have ignored: The more failure you take, the more resilient you are. If you fail after taking risks, you do not simply lose something, meanwhile you get valuable experiences and stronger personality, which help you to do better next time. Edison, the man who invented the bulbs, changed our lives, but during the experiments, he tried so many different materials and failed uncountable times, but he did not given up. However, he became more determined and experienced, and finally he found one material that was suitable for bulbs. If he had given up early, none of these would happen.

**Secondly, resilience grows through failure. Many individuals shy away from risks ==due to== fear of failure. However, they overlook a crucial truth: failure ==provides== valuable experiences and strengthens one’s character. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, ==exemplifies== this. His countless experiments ==involved== trying various materials, often r==esulting in== failure. ==Yet== he persisted. His determination and experience eventually ==led== him ==to== discover the right material for bulbs. Had he given up ==prematurely==, our lives would be vastly different.**

In conclusion, people should take risks actively, because making progress relies on taking risks, and taking risks contributes to becoming a better person.

**In conclusion, active risk-taking drives progress. By ==embracing== risks, we ==propel== ourselves forward and contribute to the betterment of society.**
