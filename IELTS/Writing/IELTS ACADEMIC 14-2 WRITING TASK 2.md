In modern world, there is ~~a~~ ongoing debate about what is the major environmental issue. Some individuals think it is the loss of species variety, while many argue that other issues are even more imminent. In this essay, I will delve into these two perspectives, and present the most important problem I believe: human activities.

**In the modern world, there is an ongoing debate about what the major environmental issue is. Some individuals believe that the loss of species variety is the major environmental issue, while others argue that other problems are even more urgent. In this essay, I will explore these two perspectives and present what I consider the most critical issue: human activities.**

Loss of existing species, or extinction, can always be breathtaking. It is undeniable that the variety is crucial to nature, a case in point is what happened in Australia. When British first set up colony in Australia, they slaughtered native wolves for safety, which would soon lead to disastrous consequence. In few years, rabbits began to reproduce without any limitation, resulting in the mass reduction of plants such as grass. Moreover, numerous animals fed on grass also went to extinction. This history told humanity a serious lesson: every species is integral to nature.

**Biodiversity—the rich variety of life on Earth—is essential for maintaining ==ecological== balance. Unfortunately, human actions have led to the extinction of numerous species. Consider the historical example of Australia: when British ==colonizers== established their presence there, they ==eradicated== native wolves for safety reasons. However, this decision had unintended consequences. With the wolves gone, rabbits multiplied unchecked, devastating plant life such as grass. Additionally, other animals that relied on grass for sustenance also faced extinction. This ==cautionary== tale ==underlines== the interconnectedness of all species within an ecosystem.**

On the other hand, increasing number of people today are advocating for other problems, climate change is the most popular topic of them. According to records, the temperature of earth has been increasing since the industrial evolution, which will cause horrible outcome. For instance, if the trend is not curbed, cities near the sea will submerged by water soon, including renowned economic centers like New York and ShangHai.

**Climate change has emerged as a ==pressing== global issue. Records show that Earth’s temperature has steadily risen since the Industrial Revolution. If this trend continues unchecked, ==coastal== cities—including major economic centers like New York and Shanghai—will face the threat of rising sea levels. The consequences are dire, affecting not only human populations but also the delicate balance of nature.**

In my opinion, both of the two issues deserve attention, but the primary reason for them, is undoubtedly: human activities. It is humans, who destroyed the habitats and made species disappeared. It is also us who burnt massive amount of fossil fuel and heated the entire globe. What is most critical is not protection, is restricting ourselves.

**Both the loss of species diversity and climate change ==share a common root cause==: human activities. We ==are responsible for== destroying habitats, driving species to extinction, and altering the planet’s climate. Our ==reliance== on fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial practices exacerbates these problems. It is time for us to recognize our impact and take ==corrective== action.**

Technology was meant to benefit us, but it is destroying the earth, and, if no countermeasure is taken, will finally spell the doom. It is time for us to recognize and stop, I believe that if we work together, we can coexist with the nature, and weave a brighter future!

**In conclusion, the major environmental challenge we face is not a single issue but rather the cumulative impact of human actions. ==By recognizing our role and working collectively, we can coexist with nature and create a brighter future for generations to come.==**
