Nowadays, there is an ongoing debate about whether we have excessive options. This essay strongly supports this idea, and presents several reasons for it.

Undeniably, material abundance has been largely improved. Since industrial revolution, humanity has enjoyed a long booming period, during which, countless technological obstacles were broken through and economies skyrocketed.

However, almost everyone can afford the movie tickets today. In addition, online media providers ~~such~~ YouTube and Netflix have made the bar even lower. What afflicts us today is not being unable to entertain, but being unable to decide.

This phenomenon reflects that occupational variety is also steadily increasing.
