Nowadays, millions of children use their mobile phones for a long time each day. There are two major reasons: Variety of games and media on the Internet, and parents' unhealthy love to their children. This essay strongly supports that addiction like this has negative effects on children's development.

**Nowadays, millions of children use their mobile phones for extended periods each day.

There is no doubt that Internet has dominated our world. Most of us on the earth now have chances to access the Internet, including not only many content creators (like "TikTokers") and game developers, who upload massive amount of interesting videos and engaging games, but also children. These young kids are undeveloped and lack of cognition, therefore they are irresistible to the temptation from Internet. What makes it worse is the unlimited love from parents. As parents, it is their duty to teach children how to use Internet correctly, yet many of them choose to spoil their children. According to Wall Street Journal, more than 50% of parents allow children to have their own smartphones, without any restriction in daily lives. Parental love is rather toxic than sweet in this case.

These kids, still in their formative years and lacking full cognitive development, find the allure of the Internet irresistible. ==What exacerbates the situation is== the ==unconditional== love parents shower upon their children. While it is a parent’s duty to ==guide== children ==in== using the Internet correctly, many choose to indulge them. ==Shockingly==, over 50% of parents allow their children to have smartphones without any restrictions in their daily lives, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.

In my opinion, being addicted to phones is bad for children's development. Firstly, spending too much time on phones means having less time to play outdoors, which can detriment their physical health. Physical exercises are essential to the development of humans' bodies, for example, playing football can significantly strengthen leg muscles, and benefits heart and lungs. Without sufficient exercises, children will be weaker and heavier, and even catch some physiological diseases. Secondly, content in the Internet are sometimes not properly filtered, something unsuitable for children like adult videos and violent videos can damage their minds.

**In my view, ==phone addiction== is detrimental to children’s development. Firstly, excessive phone use means less time spent playing outdoors, which can ==adversely== affect their physical health. Regular physical activity is ==crucial== for human development; for instance, playing football significantly strengthens leg muscles and benefits the heart and lungs. Without ==adequate== exercise, children may become weaker, heavier, and even ==susceptible to physiological ailments==. Secondly, the unfiltered content available on the Internet can be harmful. ==Exposure to inappropriate material==, ==such as== adult videos and violent content, can negatively impact young minds.**

In conclusion, children indulging themselves in phones is negative to development, and I think regulations from governments should be made to protect children.

**In conclusion, children ==immersing== themselves ==in== phones can ==hinder== their development. I believe that government regulations should be put in place to ==protect== children ==from== the potential ==downsides== of excessive phone use.**
