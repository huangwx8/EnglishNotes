The two maps demonstrate the transformation of road layout around a city hospital from 2007 to 2010.

Overall, there are three primary changes. Firstly, a new parking lot was constructed. Secondly, two intersections were redeveloped into two roundabouts. Thirdly, bus stops were replaced with a brand new bus station.

In 2007, the car park was shared by hospital staff and the public. However by 2010, a new public car park was built in the east of the hospital, allowing the previous one to serve staff exclusively. In addition, there were two intersections connecting hospital Rd with other two roads (Ring Road and City Road), they were upgraded to roundabouts to facilitate transportation.

Bus stops also experienced substantial improvements. Previously, we had six bus stops scattering alongside the hospital Rd. Now they were fully removed, giving way to a larger square bus station, which was connected to the two roundabouts and was convenient for bus drivers to access.
