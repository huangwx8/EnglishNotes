This diagram illustrates the whole process of manufacturing instant noodles.

Overall, the manufacturing process is a man-made process and contains eight phases. At the beginning, raw flour are poured into a pipeline, additions of extra materials such as water, oil, vegetables and spices are needed in the middle of the pipeline, at the end of the pipeline, instant noodles are produced in bunch.

To begin with, flour are carried by trucks and stored in storage silos. Those raw materials will soon be poured into a mixer - the start of the pipeline. In the mixer, flour are well mixed with water and oil, producing mixture. The mixture then goes through a roller, reshaped to dough sheets, which are cut into dough strips subsequently. After that, all strips are then pressed, resulting in the formation of noodles discs.

Following that, Noodles discs have to experience a series of post processing. After cooking and drying, discs are put into cups, vegetables and spices are also added at the same time. The final step is labeling and sealing, after that, the resulting products are ready for shipping!
