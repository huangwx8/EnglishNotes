This diagram demonstrates the process of transforming sugar canes to sugar products.

**This diagram demonstrates the process of transforming sugar cane into sugar products.**

Overall, this process is a man-made process, which consists of seven major steps. In the process, raw sugar canes undergo a series of steps involving human labors and machines, and are converted to sugar in the end.

First of all, it takes approximately 12 to 18 months for sugar canes to grow, and matured canes are harvested by farmers or machines. All collected canes are then feed into crushing machines, in where juice is squeezed from them.

After that, juice goes through limestone filters for purifying, in order to remove large sediments. Subsequently, It is boiled in an evaporator, usually heated by fire. With the evaporation of water, juice soon become syrup. The next step is centrifuging, which can separates sugar crystals from syrup. After proper drying and cooling, finally, we get the familiar sugar products ready for shipping!
