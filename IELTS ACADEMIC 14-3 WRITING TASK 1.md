**This diagram illustrates the working mechanism of a hydroelectric power station that generates electricity using water flow.**

Overall, hydroelectric power station has two different functions. During the day, it releases water from the high-level reservoir to the low-level and generates electricity. At night, it pumps water back into the high-level.

**The hydroelectric power station serves two distinct functions. During the day, it releases water from the high-level reservoir to the low-level, generating electricity. At night, it pumps water back into the high-level reservoir.**

Water from the river flows in the high-level reservoir and stays there. In the daytime, dam is opened, pouring the water downward to the low-level reservoir, meanwhile driving the turbines in power station to generate electricity. Those electricity will subsequently be transferred to the national grid with the power lines.

**Water from the river flows into the high-level reservoir and remains there. During the daytime, the dam is opened, ==allowing== water ==to== flow downward into the low-level reservoir. Simultaneously, the turbines in the power station are driven by the water flow, generating electricity. This electricity is then transferred to the national grid ==via== power lines.**

At night, the whole process is reversed. The turbines we used to generate electricity at day, are reversible, will act as pumpers at night. Which means it can pump the water from the low-level reservoir to the high-level, creating a upward flow. In the next morning, enough water difference is established again, and the cycle will be repeated indefinitely.

**At night, the process is reversed. The same turbines that generated electricity during the day now act as pumps. They pump water from the low-level reservoir back up to the high-level reservoir, creating an upward flow. ==By morning==, enough water difference is ==reestablished==, and the cycle repeats indefinitely.**
